# 1) How To Pull from the Master
`git pull upstream master`

This pulls the code from the "upstream" repo to your own repo, named master (not to be confused with the master repo which is named "upstream).

# 2) How to Push to Your Fork

**_Important_**

Make sure to _pull_ changes from the master (if the master repo is ahead of yours) before making any changes to your code.

1) `git add -A`

This stages your changes to commit.

2) `git commit -m "your message here"`

This commits your changes to your local.

3) `git push origin master`

This pushes your code to your fork on github. Please notify Nir or Vas once you've done this.
